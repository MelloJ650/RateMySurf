# Welcome to RateMySurf! 🤙🏻🏄🏻‍♂️

Me and my team created a surf forecasting website where users can rate the conditions independent from the forecast that we provide. Users can evaluate conditions based on the forecast given by data from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), as well as a 5-star review system from users who can post comments and pictures of their surf session for other users to gauge forecasts against real-world conditions.

Good Luck and Happy Surfing! 🌊
